# Classification Tree Algo
A basic decision tree algorithm.

For simpler understanding, the code can be broken down into:

1. CART on the Bank Note dataset

2. Load a CSV file

3. Convert string column to float

4. Split a dataset into k folds

5. Calculate accuracy percentage

6. Evaluate an algorithm using a cross validation split

7. Split a dataset based on an attribute and an attribute value

8. Calculate the Gini index for a split dataset - count all samples at split point, sum weighted Gini index for each group, avoid divide by zero, score the group based on the score for each class, weight the group score by its relative size
  
9. Elect the best split point for a dataset

10. Create a terminal node value

11. Create child splits for a node or make terminal - check for a no split, check for max depth,  process left child. process right child
	
12. Build a decision tree

13. Make a prediction with a decision tree

# Regression Tree Algorithm

A. Test CART on Bank Note dataset

B. Load and prepare data

C. Convert string attributes to integers

D. Evaluate algorithm
